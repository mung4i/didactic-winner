# Didact-Winner

Didact-Winner is an iOS application which fetches details from NASA Images API. 

## Configuration

There is only one 3rd party stack on the project and it uses cocoapods to fetch. Feel free to run `pod install` on the root of the project.


## Testing
The app uses RxTest and RxBlocking as dependencies however these are not fully integrated because the network requests are mocked but can be used in the future as the app grows
